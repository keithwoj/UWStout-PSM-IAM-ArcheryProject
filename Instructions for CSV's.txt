So previously I talked about two types of "champs":

- those with post season scores, and

- those whose career means within some top x percentile

To myself I've been referring to the groups as "post season" and "champs", respectively, so note that I've named my files with that 
in mind.

When I looked at the post-season group (defined as archers with at least one score within ~April-July of any year), only 24/150 archers 
were filtered out.  Seemed mayhap a bit too large of a subset leftover to be worth exploring separately, but I did go ahead and make a 
couple of files.

_______
First, let's look at the directory Archer_Post_Season_Rows:

First, you'll see a bunch of Archer_X.csv files.  These each contain post-season scores from those 126 archers who had at least one.
They contain the full dataframe data still, i.e: school, grade, score, etc.  After these files, you'll see full_post_season_dictionary.csv, 
which is just the Archer_X rows all concatenated into one file.  And again if you look at the dates in anything in this Post_season directory,
you should see only dates between ~April-July in there.  The other csv file, called archer_means_vs_nmbr_post_season_scores, is just that:  
all 150 archers in a list, with their career means alongside their "Number of post season scores".  The means of the 24 archers with no post season scores have been reinserted here, with Nmbr_Post_Season_Scores = 0.

________
Secondly, there are other three other directories, called Archer_Champs_10, Archer_Champs_15, and Archer_Champs_20.  Each of these files
contain files like Archer_11_10.csv or Archer_11_15.csv or Archer_11_20.csv, respectively, where the 10, 15, or 20 on the end of those 
names denotesthe top X% whence those archers were drawn.  So Archer_11_10.csv, Archer_47_10.csv, Archer_50_10.csv, etc, are Archer data from the top 10% of Archers (going by career means), whereas Archer_38_15, for instance, is from the top 15%. Note that of course all archers 
who are in the top 10% group are also in the top 15 and 20%; in this manner, Archer_11_10.csv Archer_11_15.csv, and Archer_11_20.csv that 
you'll find in all three foldres, are all the same archer: Archer_11.  (The Archer_X numbers themselves originally corresponded to the order of the .dat files as viewed in a Windows directory, but I'm not sure if that's true anymore).  

In any case, here you would just pick whichever of the three files corresponds to the top X% you want to use, and use those csv's.  
At this point I didn't concantenate these files togethter into a single one like I did the first group, but I wanted to just get this up,
without too much delay, and it seemed easy enough to cut and paste rows or columns how you want in Excel or whatever.
